# SLDC

**_SLDC_** is a framework created for accelerating development of large image analysis workflows. It is especially well 
suited for solving more or less complex problems of object detection and classification in multi-gigapixel images.

The framework encapsulates problem-independent logic such as parallelism, memory constraints (due to large image handling) 
while providing a concise way of declaring problem-dependent components of the implementer's workflows.

## Documentation

The algorithm used by the framework as well as some toy examples are presented in the [Wiki](https://github.com/waliens/sldc/wiki).

## Install

Simply: `pip install sldc`

#### On windows

On Windows, some `.dll` are needed by `shapely` and are not installed by `pip` when you install `sldc`. Therefore, you might have to install
`shapely` yourself from `conda` (i.e. `conda install shapely`) or from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#shapely) after having run `pip install sldc`.

## Bindings

The library is image format agnostic and therefore allows you to integrate it with any existing image format by implementing some interfaces. However, some bindings were implemented for integrating SLDC with: 

+ [Cytomine](http://www.cytomine.be/): [`sldc-cytomine` repository](https://github.com/waliens/sldc-cytomine) 
+ [OpenSlide](http://openslide.org/): [`sldc-openslide` repository](https://github.com/waliens/sldc-openslide)
